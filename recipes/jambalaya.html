    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Jambalaya is a cajun recipe originating in Louisiana made with rice, celery, peppers and onion; with chicken and smoked or spicy sausage like Andouille. Shrimp is often added too. This Instant Pot Jambalaya recipe does not include chicken but with a few little tricks is perfection with spicy sausage and shrimp!
