    <h1>Goat Cheese Pasta</h1>
    <img src="../img/pasta.jpg" alt="A delicious looking pasta">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Inspired by the baked feta pasta that took the internet by storm, this recipe is similarly easy but uses creamy goat cheese and comes together in a fraction of the time, thanks to the Instant Pot®! We opted for a short, tubular pasta for this dish to capture a bit of the creamy sauce inside each piece. Top with a sprinkle of fresh basil and you have a bright and flavorful dish you’ll want to make year-round.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound penne pasta</li>
        <li>2 pints (20 ounces) cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>One 8-ounce log goat cheese</li>
        <li>1/3 cup lightly packed fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the penne, cherry tomatoes, vegetable broth, olive oil, oregano, crushed red pepper flakes, garlic and 2 teaspoons salt to a 6-quart Instant Pot®. Stir to evenly combine; it’s ok if not all of the pasta and tomatoes are fully submerged in the liquid. Place the log of goat cheese on top and in the center of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Follow the manufacturer's guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on high for 5 minutes. After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer's guide for quick release and wait until the quick-release cycle is complete. Being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid.</li>
        <li>Stir the pasta together until the tomatoes have all been crushed and the cheese is thoroughly integrated into the sauce. Spoon into serving bowls and top with the basil.</li>
    </ol>
